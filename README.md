# Checklist Buddy

A GitHub app to automate task checklists or default tasks for better Pull Request compliance. Supports contextual checklists based on file patterns and branch filters to have separate default tasks for things like security, coding best practices or architecture.

Also available for [Bitbucket](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1225571/pull-request-checklist-buddy-for-bitbucket?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) and [JetBrains Space](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20330-checklist-buddy-for-space).
